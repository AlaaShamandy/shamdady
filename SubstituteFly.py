#Bug : in closed map run, units_by_age lost track of a live firefly and it just remained idle there
#Possible sol: after looping all in units_by_age check top say 5 healthiest in friendly_units, if they're not in units_by_age add them to the 8th index (friendly units is sorted by health so just check last 5 elements)
#Outcome of that sol.: bug just takes significantly longer to show up
